# jaPRO

>The main goals of this mod are as follows, in order of priority:
>
* To recreate the fast-paced fullforce combat seen in JK2, and the JA+ mod for JKA.
* To improve the MP style saber hit detection, as seen in JA+.
* To remove certain gameplay related exploits.
* To improve the weapon (gun) combat and balance.
* To add netcode features such as lag compensation for hitscan and projectiles, clientside simulated projectiles, etc.
* To add a simple admin system, with little potential for abuse.
* To add support for a race gametype, similar to racesow in warsow or defrag in quake 3, with player isolation, accounts, and persistent highscores.
* To add other gameplay enhancing features.
